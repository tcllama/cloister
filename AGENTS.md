# Validation Notes

Use the smallest validation step that matches the files you changed instead of defaulting to the full suite.

## Fastest checks

- `make fmt`

  - Use for formatting, docs, and simple Nix hygiene fixes.
  - Applies `nixfmt`, `mdformat`, `toml-sort`, `rustfmt`, `statix`, and `deadnix` fixes through the treefmt wrapper.

- `make test-changed`

  - Use for Nix module and flake changes while iterating.
  - Maps changed files to the relevant eval checks, runtime checks, and Rust helper tests.

- `make test-eval`

  - Use for the fast eval-only Nix module test subset.

- `nix develop -c make clippy`

  - Use for Rust helper changes when you need lint coverage.

## Nix validation

Run `nix flake check --print-build-logs` when you need the full flake-wide validation pass, especially before merging cross-cutting changes.

## What to run by change type

- `docs/**`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, simple formatting-only edits

  - Run `make fmt`.

- `modules/**`, `flake.nix`, `pkgs/**`

  - Run `make test-changed`.
  - Use `make test-eval` when you want the full eval-only module pass.
  - Use `nix flake check --print-build-logs` before merging cross-cutting changes.

- `helpers/**/src/**`

  - Run `nix develop -c make clippy`.
  - Add `make test-changed` if the Rust helper is wired into module behavior or packaging.
  - Add `nix flake check --print-build-logs` when the change also affects broader flake wiring.

- `Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock`

  - Run `nix develop -c make clippy`.
  - Add `cargo-audit` when dependencies changed.

## Writing tests

- Keep tests scoped to the module or package they verify so `make test-changed` can select the right subset during development.
- Prefer extending an existing eval or runtime test when coverage belongs with that area instead of adding broad cross-cutting tests that force unrelated checks to run.
- Keep fixtures and test inputs minimal; avoid unnecessary evaluations, large generated data, or duplicated setups that slow down the red -> change -> green loop.
- Split unrelated behaviors into separate focused tests only when they still map cleanly to the changed files and do not widen the `make test-changed` surface area.
- Reserve full-suite coverage for behavior that truly spans multiple test areas; otherwise optimize for fast targeted iteration first.

## Notes

- `make test-changed` is the default Nix validation command while iterating.
- `make test` runs the full Nix test suite (eval plus runtime checks) in one `nix build`.
- `make test-eval` runs only the eval checks.
- `nix flake check` still includes the `treefmt` check, while `make fmt` now applies fixes first and then verifies the treefmt check is clean.
- Prefer targeted commands while iterating; run the broader suite before merging cross-cutting changes.
